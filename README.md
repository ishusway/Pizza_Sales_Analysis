# Pizza_Sales_Analysis

I have taken this data from youtube and completed the project using my style of query writing.
I like CTE more then subquery in many cases it makes the code more readable and elegant.
This data set is small and it is easily understandable but then also I have tried to sover most of the 
topics related to SQL in our Query. 
Please let me know if you found some erors that can be improved or tell me the more efficient way of 
writing any query in this project. I am making a report of this on power Bi and will upload soon.
